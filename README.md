## 🔥 Why I Built This
There are lots of trip planners out there in the world, but most of them focus on flight and hotel reservation systems rather than actual advantures. Furthermore, many AI-powered trip planners have been built by big companies. I get why many companies have gone in this direction — mainly for profitability and other practical reasons.

However, I personally believe that traveling is more about learning new things and discovering yourself through new experiences.

So I started thinking — where do I get most of my new experiences, directly or indirectly? For me, platforms like Instagram and YouTube are where I find the most inspiration and new ideas.
That’s why I want to build a social network focused on 🌍 travel, 🚀 exploration, and 🌱 new experiences.

This is just the beginning of my idea. I hope to share the full project with you as soon as possible!!
